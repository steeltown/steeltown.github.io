            <h2>Director&#39;s Statement</h2>
            <div class="inner" style="text-align: justify;">
                <p><b>The Homestead Strike happened 120 years ago. Why tell the story now?</b></p>
                <p>This story of charismatic leaders and ruthless capitalism holds a certain relevance to key issues of wealth and organized labor that our nation faces today. This work will address issues of workers&#39; welfare, labor rights, and economic equality that hold a special importance in the wake of the recent Occupy Movement and the empowering of the &#34;Ninety-Nine Percent&#34;. One-hundred and twenty years after the Homestead Strike, the context of organized labor debates has changed, but the underlying message of workers&#39; rights remains the same.</p>
                <p>The inspiration for this film stems from an appreciation for the strength of character of individuals on both sides of the conflict, including the rags-to-riches robber barons of the Gilded Age, like Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick, and the blue-collar champions of the workers, like strike leader Hugh O&#39;Donnell. I wish to remind audiences of the heroism embedded in the nameless Pittsburgh steelworkers whose backbreaking work shaped our country westward and skyward. This work will aim to shed light on both sides of the conflict. By presenting the story as a dramatic film with high production quality, I aim to prompt an important dialogue on the relationship between capital and labor in the context of past tragedies and triumphs.</p>
                <p><b>Why a short film?</b></p>
                <p class="last">Film is the most effective medium to tell the story of the Homestead Strike to a generation of younger students and Pittsburgh residents. Producing the film as a dramatic narrative rather than a documentary will allow us to convey the energy and passion of the time period and connect with our audience on an emotional level.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">Set in Homestead, PA in 1892, Hugh O&#39;Donnell struggles to maintain order among fellow steelworkers as wages are cut and working conditions decline under the ruthless management of Henry Clay Frick. Mounting tensions forebode a brutal workers&#39; strike, but O&#39;Donnell is determined to find a peaceful solution to this historic clash between capital and labor.</p>
